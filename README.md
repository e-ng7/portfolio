# The Singaporean Covid Story

## Objective
The objective of this project is to form a data visualisation dashboard and summarise different aspects of Singapore's fight against the Covid-19 pandemic so far

## Datasets
1) Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/
2) Singapore Ministry of Health COVID-19 Situation Reports from https://covidsitrep.moh.gov.sg/

**Data shown in the dataset used are up till 31 July 2021**

## Description
Using SQL queries, we are able to perform some data exploration of the data in the dataset and noted any missing data and what types of data are in the dataset downloaded from ourworldindata.org. We wrote specific SQL queries to identify selected variables we require for the dashboard including:
1) Vaccination Progress Rates / % of Population Vaccinated
2) Location of active clusters in Singapore
3) Weekly average fatality rates
4) Total number of Covid-19 cases
4) Case Fatality Rate (Total Death/Total number of Cases)
